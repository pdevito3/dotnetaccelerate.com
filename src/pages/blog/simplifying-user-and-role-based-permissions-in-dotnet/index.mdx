## Introduction

For my [upcoming release of Craftsman](https://github.com/pdevito3/craftsman) I wanted to add better support for managing permissions to the various features in my projects. 
After a ton of research, I came across [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dlrf85NTuAU) by Dominick Baier that really struck a cord. Here's where I 
landed on managing my permissions in my .NET projects.

## The Current State of Permissions in .NET

Let's start by differentiating 3 different levels of permissions:

| Permission Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Application Access | These are generally configured in your auth server and passed along in your token (e.g. using audience (aud) claim to determine what apis a token can be used in). |
| Feature Access | Permission specific checks in a particular application boundary (e.g. can a user perform some action). |
| Application Logic | Custom business logic specific to your application (e.g. given this certain set of criteria, can a user perform some action). |

In this post, I want to focus on feature access.

### The Gaps with Authorization Policies in .NET

Out of the box with .NET, we can easily decorate our controllers like this `[Authorize(Policy = "RecipesFullAccess")]` and register it in `AddAuthorization`, but **how do we check if the user has that claim?**

One of the most common solutions to this is to load up your policies in your security token.

```json
{
  "sub": "145hfy662",
  "name": "John Smith",
  "aud": ["api1", "api2"],
  "permission": [
    "ManageRecipe",
    "CreateNewRecipe",
    "UpdateIngredients"
  ]
}
```

This can work, but but there are some downside here:

- Your JWT gets quickly overloaded, potentially to the point of being too big to even put into a cookie. Ideally, your token is only passing along user identity information only.
- You don't have context for the permission. Let's look at a couple examples:
    - As mentioned above, we generally use the `aud` claim (or maybe some custom one) to determine what apis your security token can be used in. So in the example above we have `"aud": ["api1", "api2"],` and one of my permissions is `ManageRecipe`. What if I am allowed to manage recipes in `api1` but not `api2`? You could prefix them with something like `api1.ManageRecipe`, but that adds coupling, domain logic, and becomes a huge multipler in the amount of claims being passed around.
    - Say I have a permission `CanDrinkAlcohol` but depending on where I'm at in the world it may or may not be true based on my age. I could tag it with something like `US.CanDrink`, `UK.CanDrink`, etc. but this would be far from ideal for a variety of reasons.
- Tokens are only given at authentication time, so if you need to update permissions, you need to invalidate all the issued tokens every time you make an update. You could also make token lifetimes very short to get more up to date info more often, but that is not ideal either and still has coupling of identity and permissions.

### So, What Do We Do?

Well, we can still get identity state from our identity server like we usually do. Usually, that should include some kind of role or set of roles that the user has been assigned to. 
These roles can then be mapped to permissions and used as a reference to a group of permissions. Maybe something like this:

```json
{
  "sub": "145hfy662",
  "name": "John Smith",
  "aud": ["api1", "api2"],
  "role": [
    "Chef",
    "Admin"
  ]
}
```

> It's important to note that, if you're using roles (there are other options below) these roles should be identity based and make 
sense across your whole domain, not just a particular boundary. For instance, something like `InventoryManager` would be better than something like `Approver`.

So we have our user and their identity roles from our auth token, but **how do we know what permissions go with our roles?** Well, this can be done in a variety of ways to whatever suits 
your needs best for your api.

- If you have a simple API or an API that rarely has modified permissions, maybe you just want keep a static list of role to permissions mappings in a class in your project or in your `appsettings`.
- More commonly, you'll probably want to persist them in a database somewhere. This could be in your boundary/application database or it could be in a separate administration boundary. 
Maybe you have both and use eventual consistency to keep them in sync. You could even add a caching layer on top of this as well and reference that.
- You could even forgo roles all together and just assign permissions directly tyo users, though this would probably get pretty messy.

**At the end of the day, you can store your permission mappings anywhere you want, but you still need a way to easily access them and integrate them into your permissions pipeline**. 

## Enter HeimGuard

Putting together a pattern for this permission mapping is where I was very much inspired by how Dominick et al. set up [Policy Server](https://policyserver.io/) 
and came up with a similar solution. I was even able to package it up into a (very) [simple library that I called HeimGuard](https://github.com/pdevito3/HeimGuard). 
It really is just a couple of files if you want to check it out (or even pull them out separately into your own project), 
but it does seem to fill this permission mapping gap quite well. 

Below is an example of how the permission abstraction works to easily manage feature access in your .NET apps.

### How It Works

1. Let's start with adding an authorization attribute. Nothing new here, this is just normal .NET:
    
    ```csharp
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
    
    [ApiController]
    [Route("recipes")]
    [Authorize(Policy = "RecipesFullAccess")]
    public class RecipesController : ControllerBase
    {
        [HttpGet]
        public IActionResult Get()
        {
            return Ok();
        }
    }
    ```
    
2. Next, I'm going to put my user's role in my `ClaimPrincipal`. This isn't required for HeimGuard to work (you don't even need roles at all actually), but is what we'll use for this example.
    
    ```json
    {
      "sub": "145hfy662",
      "name": "John Smith",
      "aud": ["api1", "api2"],
      "role": ["Chef"]
    }
    ```
    
3. Now I'm going to implement an interface from HeimGuard called `IUserPolicyHandler`. This handler is responsible for implementing your permissions lookup for your user. **HeimGuard doesn't care how you store permissions and how you access them. The only requirement is that it should return an `IEnumerable<string>` that stores all of the permissions that your user has available to them.**
    
    Again, we can implement it however we want, but for this example, let's do something like this. More details in a minute.
    
    ```csharp    
    using System.Security.Claims;
    using RecipeManagement.Databases;
    using RecipeManagement.Domain;
    using HeimGuard;
    using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
    
    public class UserPolicyHandler : IUserPolicyHandler
    {
        // this is my database where I maintain a table called RolePermissions
        private readonly RecipesDbContext _dbContext;
    
        // this service has a method that can get the ClaimPrincipal for me
        private readonly ICurrentUserService _currentUserService;
    
        public UserPolicyHandler(RecipesDbContext dbContext, ICurrentUserService currentUserService)
        {
            _dbContext = dbContext;
            _currentUserService = currentUserService;
        }
        
        public async Task<IEnumerable<string>> GetUserPermissions()
        {
            var user = _currentUserService.User;
            if (user == null) throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(user));
    
            var roles = user.Claims
                .Where(c => c.Type == ClaimTypes.Role)
                .Select(r => r.Value)
                .Distinct()
                .ToArray();
            
            // super admins can do everything
            if(roles.Contains(Roles.SuperAdmin))
                return Permissions.List();
    
            var permissions = await _dbContext.RolePermissions
                .Where(rp => roles.Contains(rp.Role))
                .Select(rp => rp.Permission)
                .Distinct()
                .ToArrayAsync();
    
            return await Task.FromResult(permissions);
        }
    }
    ```
    
4. Then, we just need to register HeimGuard and our `UserPolicyService`. Again, more details on what's happening here below.
    
    ```csharp
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        //... other services
        services.AddHeimGuard<UserPolicyHandler>()
            .AutomaticallyCheckPermissions()
            .MapAuthorizationPolicies();
    }
    ```
    

That's it! Now any controller with an `Authorize` attribute will automatically be protected and only allowed access if a user has the given permission mapped to their role (again, doesn't have to be role based, but that's what I'm doing in this example.

### Breaking It Down: Permissions

First, permissions. You can store these however you want, but in this example, I'm storing my permissions in a static class. This seems pretty reasonable 
to me as permission assignments to our features are only added or updated as code changes anyway.

```csharp
using System.Reflection;

public static class Permissions
{
    public const string CanDeleteRecipe = "CanDeleteRecipe";
    public const string CanUpdateRecipe = "CanUpdateRecipe";
    public const string CanAddRecipe = "CanAddRecipe";
    public const string CanReadRecipes = "CanReadRecipes";
    public const string CanDeleteRolePermission = "CanDeleteRolePermission";
    public const string CanUpdateRolePermission = "CanUpdateRolePermission";
    public const string CanAddRolePermission = "CanAddRolePermission";
    public const string CanReadRolePermissions = "CanReadRolePermissions";

    public static List<string>List()
    {
        return typeof(Permissions)
            .GetFields(BindingFlags.Public| BindingFlags.Static| BindingFlags.FlattenHierarchy)
            .Where(fi => fi.IsLiteral && !fi.IsInitOnly && fi.FieldType == typeof(string))
            .Select(x => (string)x.GetRawConstantValue())
            .ToList();
    }
}

```

### Breaking It Down: Roles

Next, in my case, I'd like to group permissions together using a role, so I'm going to establish what roles I'm able to have. I also chose a static class here, but 
in many cases this you might want to abstract this out elsewhere.

```csharp
using System.Reflection;

public static class Roles
{
    public const string SuperAdmin = "SuperAdmin";
    public const string User = "User";
    
    public static List<string> List()
    {
        return typeof(Roles)
            .GetFields(BindingFlags.Public | BindingFlags.Static | BindingFlags.FlattenHierarchy)
            .Where(fi => fi.IsLiteral && !fi.IsInitOnly && fi.FieldType == typeof(string))
            .Select(x => (string)x.GetRawConstantValue())
            .ToList();
    }
}
```

### Breaking It Down: Getting User Permissions

Let's look at the `GetUserPermissions` method that we implemented again in more detail.

First, let's look at the constructor. I have two services here; one to get the current user (i.e. from the ClaimsPrincipal) and another to get my db where I'm storing how my permissions map to my roles.

```csharp
private readonly RecipesDbContext _dbContext;
private readonly ICurrentUserService _currentUserService;

public UserPolicyHandler(RecipesDbContext dbContext, ICurrentUserService currentUserService)
{
    _dbContext = dbContext;
    _currentUserService = currentUserService;
}
```

I start the method by getting the user that we want to work with and making sure they exist:

```csharp
var user = _httpContextAccessor.HttpContext?.User;
if (user == null) throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(user));
```

Next, I get the roles for that user. In this case, the role is in the user's ClaimPrincipal, but this could be stored in a `UserRole` table in an administration database or wherever else makes sense for your project. 

```csharp
var roles = user.Claims
    .Where(c => c.Type == ClaimTypes.Role)
    .Select(r => r.Value)
    .Distinct()
    .ToArray();
```

Then, if the user is a `SuperAdmin` I want to give them all permissions, otherwise, I get the permissions for all the roles I found out of the database. Regardless, I finish by returning the permissions for HeimGuard to use.

```csharp

if(roles.Contains(Roles.SuperAdmin))
    return Permissions.List();

var permissions = await _dbContext.RolePermissions
    .Where(rp => roles.Contains(rp.Role))
    .Select(rp => rp.Permission)
    .Distinct()
    .ToArrayAsync();

return await Task.FromResult(permissions);
```

### Breaking It Down: Registering HeimGuard Services

So we set up HeimGuard like so:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    //... other services
    services.AddHeimGuard<UserPolicyHandler>()
      .AutomaticallyCheckPermissions()
      .MapAuthorizationPolicies();
}
```

1. `AddHeimGuard<UserPolicyHandler>()` is there to register the `UserPolicyHandler` implementation that we made.
2. `AutomaticallyCheckPermissions` is optional, but a big timesaver. 
When this is added, you HeimGuard will automatically check the user's permissions against any controller that has an `Authorize` attribute. Without this, you can manually check a user's permissions like so:
    
```csharp
    using HeimGuard;
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
    
    [ApiController]
    [Route("recipes")]
    [Authorize]
    public class RecipesController : ControllerBase
    {
        private readonly IHeimGuardClient _heimGuard;
    
        public RecipesController(IHeimGuardClient heimGuard)
        {
            _heimGuard = heimGuard;
        }
        
        [HttpGet]
        public IActionResult Get()
        {
            return _heimGuard.HasPermissionAsync("RecipesFullAccess") 
              ? Ok()
              : Forbidden();
        }
    }
```
    
3. `MapAuthorizationPolicies` will automatically map authorization attributes to ASP.NET Core authorization policies that haven't already been mapped. That means you don't have to do something like this for all your policies:
    
    ```csharp
    services.AddAuthorization(options =>
    {
        options.AddPolicy("RecipesFullAccess",
            policy => policy.RequireClaim("permission", "RecipesFullAccess"));
    });
    ```
    

## Conclusion

I'm going to dog food the process some more to see what tweaks I want to make, but so far I've really enjoyed using this process 
for managing my permissions! Whether you decide to give HeimGuard a try or not, I hope this post was helpful.
