## What are We Building?
Let's say that we want to create an application to manage recipes. We're going to call it `CarbonKitchen` and it 
should start out by storing recipes and their associated ingredients. 

## Creating a Template File
To get things started, we we are going to build a bare bones `yaml` or `json` file to lay out what we want our project to look like. This file is going to describe what our particular domain looks like 
and then we can add additional features and logic afterward.

Don't feel pressured to get this exactly correct from the get go. **This file is NOT meant to be a concrete implementation of your API**, just a starting point that you can build on over time. 

So what's this file look like? Let's go over an example. For a full list of the configuration option details, you can go to the [domain-template page](/docs/domain-template).


### Basic Domain and Bounded Context Setup
We're going to start out by creating a new `yaml` file and adding a domain name of `CarbonKitchen`. 

```yaml
DomainName: CarbonKitchen
```

Next, we need to lay out each of the logical contextual boundaries within our domain (a.k.a. bounded contexts).
In this domain, three come to mind: 1) `Recipes` to store our recipes 2) `Planning` to store our meal plans and 3) `Shopping` to store our shopping lists. 
Let's start out with the `RecipeManagement` bounded context and name it with a property called `ProjectName`. 

```yaml
DomainName: CarbonKitchen
BoundedContexts:
- ProjectName: RecipeManagement
```

Then, we'll describe our database set up for each bounded context using the [DbContext](/docs/db-context) 
property. I'm also going to set port to run on locally, but this is optional.

```yaml
DomainName: CarbonKitchen
BoundedContexts:
- ProjectName: RecipeManagement
  Port: 5005
  DbContext:
   ContextName: RecipesDbContext
   DatabaseName: RecipeManagement
   Provider: postgres
```

### Entity Setup
Then let's add in our `Recipe` [Entity](/docs/entities) with a variety of 
properties based on our requirements. Be sure to check the [entity properties](/docs/entities#entity-properties) page to 
see what's required and what defaults are used. We're also going to add the [features](/docs/entities#features) that we want for this particular entity.


```yaml
DomainName: CarbonKitchen
BoundedContexts:
- ProjectName: RecipeManagement
  Port: 5005
  DbContext:
   ContextName: RecipesDbContext
   DatabaseName: RecipeManagement
   Provider: postgres
  Entities:
  - Name: Recipe
    Features:
    - Type: AddRecord
    - Type: GetRecord
    - Type: GetList
    - Type: UpdateRecord
    - Type: DeleteRecord
    Properties:
    - Name: Title
      Type: string
      CanFilter: true
      CanSort: true
    - Name: Directions
      Type: string
      CanFilter: true
      CanSort: true
    - Name: RecipeSourceLink
      Type: string
      CanFilter: true
      CanSort: true
    - Name: Description
      Type: string
      CanFilter: true
      CanSort: true
    - Name: ImageLink
      Type: string
      CanFilter: true
      CanSort: true
```

Note that `Entities` is a list, so we can add more than one if we want:

```yaml
DomainName: CarbonKitchen
BoundedContexts:
- ProjectName: RecipeManagement
  Port: 5005
  DbContext:
   ContextName: RecipesDbContext
   DatabaseName: RecipeManagement
   Provider: postgres
  Entities:
  - Name: Recipe
    Features:
    - Type: AddRecord
    - Type: GetRecord
    - Type: GetList
    - Type: UpdateRecord
    - Type: DeleteRecord
    Properties:
    - Name: Title
      Type: string
      CanFilter: true
      CanSort: true
    - Name: Directions
      Type: string
      CanFilter: true
      CanSort: true
    - Name: RecipeSourceLink
      Type: string
      CanFilter: true
      CanSort: true
    - Name: Description
      Type: string
      CanFilter: true
      CanSort: true
    - Name: ImageLink
      Type: string
      CanFilter: true
      CanSort: true
  - Name: Ingredient
    Features:
    - Type: AddRecord
    - Type: GetRecord
    - Type: GetList
    - Type: UpdateRecord
    - Type: DeleteRecord
    Properties:
    - Name: RecipeId
      Type: int?
      CanFilter: true
      CanSort: true
    - Name: Name
      Type: string
      CanFilter: true
      CanSort: true
    - Name: Unit
      Type: string
      CanFilter: true
      CanSort: true
    - Name: Amount
      Type: double?
      CanFilter: true
      CanSort: true
```

### Swagger Setup
Now I'm going to add in some Swagger documentation to provide a little extra context. Optional, but nice to have. You can also add other optional properties like [authorization settings](/docs/authorization-settings) if you'd like to include those here.

```yaml
DomainName: CarbonKitchen
BoundedContexts:
- ProjectName: RecipeManagement
  Port: 5005
  DbContext:
   ContextName: RecipesDbContext
   DatabaseName: RecipeManagement
   Provider: postgres
  Entities:
  - Name: Recipe
    Features:
    - Type: AddRecord
    - Type: GetRecord
    - Type: GetList
    - Type: UpdateRecord
    - Type: DeleteRecord
    Properties:
    - Name: Title
      Type: string
      CanFilter: true
      CanSort: true
    - Name: Directions
      Type: string
      CanFilter: true
      CanSort: true
    - Name: RecipeSourceLink
      Type: string
      CanFilter: true
      CanSort: true
    - Name: Description
      Type: string
      CanFilter: true
      CanSort: true
    - Name: ImageLink
      Type: string
      CanFilter: true
      CanSort: true
  - Name: Ingredient
    Features:
    - Type: AddRecord
    - Type: GetRecord
    - Type: GetList
    - Type: UpdateRecord
    - Type: DeleteRecord
    Properties:
    - Name: RecipeId
      Type: int?
      CanFilter: true
      CanSort: true
    - Name: Name
      Type: string
      CanFilter: true
      CanSort: true
    - Name: Unit
      Type: string
      CanFilter: true
      CanSort: true
    - Name: Amount
      Type: double?
      CanFilter: true
      CanSort: true
  SwaggerConfig:
    Title: Carbon Kitchen Recipes
    Description: Our API uses a REST based design, leverages the JSON data format, and relies upon HTTPS for transport. We respond with meaningful HTTP response codes and if an error occurs, we include error details in the response body. API Documentation is at carbonkitchen.com/dev/docs
    ApiContact: 
      Name: Carbon Kitchen
      Email: devsupport@CarbonKitchen.com
      Url: https://www.carbonkitchen.com
```

## Creating a New Domain Solution
Now that we've put together our domain layout, let's actually build our solution. To start, make sure you've followed the [install instructions](/docs/installation).
Then, open Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, etc. and `cd` to whatever directory you want to create your project repository in. Finally, we just need to run [one command](/docs/new-domain):

```shell
craftsman new:domain C:\Users\Paul\Documents\WraptTemplates\NewCarbonKitchen.yaml
```

> Note that the filepath here should match wherever you saved your yaml file. A relative path should also work.

Once that's done, Craftsman will have added an entire API for you in whatever directory you ran this in. Check out the [project architecture and organization](/docs/project-organization) page for more details.

### Using Your API 
Now you can `cd` into your bounded context directory and run `dotnet run --project {ProjectName}` and your API is up and all the boilerplate taken care of ðŸ¥³

## Adding a New Entity
So, we have this existing project, but what if we wanted to add a new entity to capture shopping list items so that we can add ingredients we need for our grocery outing? 
All we need to do is create another `yaml` or `json` file (based on the [add entity template](/docs/entity-template)) that describes this new entity. Something like this:

```yaml
AddSwaggerComments: true
Entities:
- Name: ShoppingListItem
  Features:
  - Type: AddRecord
  - Type: GetRecord
  - Type: GetList
  - Type: UpdateRecord
  - Type: DeleteRecord
  Properties:
  - Name: Amount
    Type: double?
    CanFilter: true
    CanSort: true
  - Name: Name
    Type: string
    CanFilter: true
    CanSort: true
  - Name: Category
    Type: string
    CanFilter: true
    CanSort: true
  - Name: Unit
    Type: string
    CanFilter: true
    CanSort: true
```

Then, we can add that entity to our project using the [add:entity command](/docs/add-entity):

```shell
craftsman add:entity C:\Users\Paul\Documents\WraptTemplates\ShoppingListEntity.yaml
```

## Adding a New Bounded Context
So we built out the bounded context for our `Recipes`, but what if we wanted to add the `Shopping` bounded context? Let's make a 
new file (using a [bounded-contexts template](/docs/bounded-contexts) to capture those details:

```yaml
BoundedContexts:
- ProjectName: ShoppingManagement
  Port: 5010
  DbContext:
   ContextName: ShoppingDbContext
   DatabaseName: ShoppingManagement
   Provider: Postgres
  Entities:
  - Name: ShoppingList
    Features:
    - Type: AddRecord
    - Type: GetRecord
    - Type: GetList
    - Type: UpdateRecord
    - Type: DeleteRecord
    Properties:
    - Name: Store
      Type: string
      CanFilter: true
      CanSort: true
  SwaggerConfig:
    Title: Carbon Kitchen Shopping
    Description: Our API uses a REST based design, leverages the JSON data format, and relies upon HTTPS for transport. We respond with meaningful HTTP response codes and if an error occurs, we include error details in the response body. API Documentation is at carbonkitchen.com/dev/docs
    ApiContact: 
      Name: Carbon Kitchen
      Email: devsupport@CarbonKitchen.com
      Url: https://www.carbonkitchen.com
```

Then we can go to our domain directory (the one with the .gitignore):

```shell
cd C:\my\domain\directory
```

Then we can use the [add:bc command](/docs/add-bounded-context) to add the new context:

```shell
add:bc C:\fullpath\my-new-bc.yaml
```

## Customization
Great! Now we have a new project, but we want to add some custom business logic. Maybe we want to do some special validation when we're adding a new recipe or add another 
endpoint to manage ingredients in batch. This is all completely doable! For details, see the page on [customizing Wrapt projects](/docs/customizing-wrapt-projects).
