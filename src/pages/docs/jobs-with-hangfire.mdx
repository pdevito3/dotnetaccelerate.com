description: A walkthrough of working with Hangfire to set up jobs in Wrapt projects

## What is Hangfire?

Hangfire is a library that allows you to perform background jobs to perform tasks out of process. It's a
great way to offload long running tasks from your web server to a background process or to schedule jobs
to run at a later time.

These might sound similar to publishing events to something like RabbitMQ, but generally, that would be
better for communication **between** boundaries, where Hangfire jobs are great for leveraging **inter-boundary concerns**
and let's a boundary kick something to a longer running out of process task that can happen in the background and stay
within it's own context.

Some examples of jobs might be migrating data from a legacy system, sending emails, enriching records,
or performing some sort of data processing.

## How Hangfire is Setup in Wrapt

Setting up Hangfire in a .NET project is pretty simple and is just done using a standard setup in Wrapt projects. By default,
your project will just be using the in-memory storage for Hangfire, but you can easily switch to a SQL Server database or
some other option depending on your needs.

## How to Create a Job

Wrapt doesn't have any special handling around job creation, but it does let you scaffold out [a job as feature](/docs/entities#hangfire-jobs)
to save some time.

### User Context for Your Jobs

If you're using auth, you will likely want to provide user context to the job so that context can be given when running the job. Out of the box,
your project will have a `CurrentUserFilter` attribute that will automatically provide the user context to the job for whoever called this method.
One common expansion you could make to this might be to add another filter that just sets the user to some generic job user if you don't care
who called it. For example, you could do something like this:

```csharp
public class JobUserFilterAttribute : JobFilterAttribute, IClientFilter
{
    public void OnCreating(CreatingContext context)
    {
        var user = "job-user-a6c244ad-5c29-4f61-a272-4c6abc099abb";
        context.SetJobParameter("User", user);
    }

    public void OnCreated(CreatedContext context)
    {
    }
}
```

Then you could use it like this:

```csharp
public class DeleteRecipeAsJob
{
    private readonly IRecipeRepository _recipeRepository;
    private readonly IUnitOfWork _unitOfWork;
    private readonly IHeimGuardClient _heimGuard;

    public DeleteRecipeAsJob(IRecipeRepository recipeRepository, IUnitOfWork unitOfWork, IHeimGuardClient heimGuard)
    {
        _recipeRepository = recipeRepository;
        _unitOfWork = unitOfWork;
        _heimGuard = heimGuard;
    }

    public sealed record Command(Guid Id);

    [JobDisplayName("Delete Recipe")]
    [JobUserFilter]
    public async Task Handle(Command request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        await _heimGuard.MustHavePermission<ForbiddenAccessException>(Permissions.CanDeleteRecipes);

        var recordToDelete = await _recipeRepository.GetById(request.Id, cancellationToken: cancellationToken);
        _recipeRepository.Remove(recordToDelete);
        await _unitOfWork.CommitChanges(cancellationToken);
    }
}
```

## Testing Hangfire Jobs

You can test Hangfire jobs in two ways. You can test the job itself, or you can test the entire job flow.

If you want to test the job itself, you can use an integration test to test the job in isolation. An skeleton test
should be generated for you when scaffolding the job feature.

If you want to test an entire job flow, you'll need to do it in a functional test where the hosted service
for the job is actually running on the web host factory. For example, say you have a job that deletes a Recipe,
I can hit the endpoint that triggers the job, wait for the job to complete, and then check the database to make sure it's gone.

```csharp
    [Fact]
    public async Task can_test_job_flow()
    {
        // Arrange
        var recipe = new FakeRecipeBuilder().Build();

        var user = await AddNewSuperAdmin();
        FactoryClient.AddAuth(user.Identifier);
        await InsertAsync(recipe);

        // Act
        var route = $"{ApiRoutes.Recipes.Delete(recipe.Id)}/asjob";
        var result = await FactoryClient.DeleteRequestAsync(route);

        // Assert
        result.StatusCode.Should().Be(HttpStatusCode.NoContent);

        await Task.Delay(500);
        var dbRecipe = await ExecuteDbContextAsync(db => db.Recipes.FirstOrDefaultAsync(x => x.Id == recipe.Id));
        dbRecipe.Should().BeNull();
    }
```

### Hangfire Tags

If you want to use tags with your jobs, the current hangfire abstraction might give you problems in your
integration tests given the way the Tags library is built. The simplest way around this is to create a wrapper
around the tag creation method to not apply tags when in the testing env.

## Hangfire Dashboard

The hangfire dashboard is available at `/hangfire`. There are protections on it to only show in development, but can (and should) be
expanded on to show in other environments with whatever makes sense in your larger business context.
