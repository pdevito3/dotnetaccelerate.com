## Entities

A list of database entities in your project. These entities are added as dbsets to your database context, so they translate 1:1 to tables in your database.
With that said, if you want to create an aggregate, you can scaffold out an entity and update it accordingly to reflect that aggregate yourself (e.g. remove the db set).

| Type                | No       | The data type for the property. These are _not_ case sensitive and they can be set to nullable with a trailing `?`. All standard C# data types can be used here. You even do custom properties like classes that act as foreign keys for instance.                                                                   | _string_                           |
| IsRequired          | No       | When true, the property will be set as required in the database.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | false<br/>_true for primary key_   |

| CanManipulate       | No       | When set to false, you will not be able to update this property when calling the associated endpoint. When set to `false`, the property will be able to be established when using the POST endpoint, but will not be able to be updated after that. This is managed by the DTOs if you want to manually adjust this. | true<br/>_false for primary key_   |
| DefaultValue        | No       | Allows you to add a default value to a property. Note that it should be entered exactly as you'd want it, so a string would be something like `"My Default Value"`, a bool might be `true`, and an int might be `0`                                                                                                  | _None_                             |
| ForeignEntityName   | No       | Captures the name of the entity this property is linked to as a foreign key.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | _None_                             |

| IsChildRelationship | No       | Only used when establishing a relationship. Designates whether or not a relationship property is being set from the child entity.                                                                                                                                                                                    | _false_                            |
| SmartNames          | No       | A list of strings used to create a smart enum property. Each string denotes an option for the smart enum. See [the smart enum example below](#smart-enums) for details. Property attributes like filtering and sorting can be used if desired.                                                                       | _None_                             |

<!-- | Auditable          | No       | This will determine if an entity is auditable or not. See [Auditable Entities](#auditable-entities) for more information | false                            | -->

### Features

| Name           | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Default            |
| -------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Type           | Yes      | The type of feature you want to add. The accepted values are `AdHoc`, `Job`, `GetRecord`, `GetList`, `GetAll`, `DeleteRecord`, `UpdateRecord`, `AddRecord`, and `CreateRecord` (same as `AddRecord` but available as an alias in case you can't remember!) | _None_             |
| IsProtected    | No       | Determines whether or not the feature is protected with an authorization policy attribute.                                                                                                                                                                 | _false_            |
| PermissionName | No       | The name of the authorization policy attribute.                                                                                                                                                                                                            | _Can[FEATURENAME]_ |

`GetRecord`, `GetList`, `GetAll`, `DeleteRecord`, `UpdateRecord`, `AddRecord`, and `AddListByFk` are all standard CRUD features along with their endpoints and associated tests.

> â„¹ DTOs, validators, profiles and functional test routes associated to all features will be added regardless of whether or not a given feature was added. This is due to the complexity of all
> the minute management around handling these so dynamically. Feel free to delete whatever you're not using.

#### AddListByFk Feature

The `AddListByFk` will let you add a list or batch of records using a foreign key. For example, you can add a list of ingredients for a recipe, based on the id of a recipe.

| Name               | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                     | Default |
| ------------------ | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| BatchPropertyName  | Yes      | The name of the property on the foreign entity you are doing a batch add on.                                                                                                                    | _None_  |
| BatchPropertyType  | Yes      | The data type of the the property you are doing the batch add on. This is for a FK property, so probably a Guid or int.                                                                         | _None_  |
| ParentEntity       | Yes      | The name of the parent entity that the FK you using is associated to. For example, if you had a FK of `EventId`, the parent entity might be `Event`. Leave null if you're not batching on a FK. | _None_  |
| ParentEntityPlural | Yes      | The plural of the FK entity. Leave null if you're not batching on a FK.                                                                                                                         | _None_  |

#### Hangfire Jobs

You can also add features that will be setup for a Hangfire job instead of a MediatR handler using the `Job` feature type.

| Name         | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                               | Default         |
| ------------ | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Name         | Yes      | The name of the feature. This is the name of the feature's method and would generally be something like `AddCustomer` or `GetCustomer`.                                                   | _None_          |
| EntityPlural | No       | The plural name of the entity that the feature will be added to (should match the name in the `Domain` directory). You can leave this blank to add it to the `Domain` directory directly. | _[ENTITYNAME]s_ |

#### Ad Hoc Features

You can also add ad hoc skeletons with the `AdHoc` type. For `AdHoc` features, there's a bit more that needs to be done. In addition to `Type` above, you'll want to provide the below:

| Name         | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                | Default         |
| ------------ | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Name         | Yes      | The name of the feature. This is the name of the feature's method and would generally be something like `AddCustomer` or `GetCustomer`.                                                                    | _None_          |
| EntityPlural | No       | The plural name of the entity that the feature will be added to (should match the name in the `Domain` directory). You can leave this blank to add it to the `Domain` directory directly.                  | _[ENTITYNAME]s_ |
| ResponseType | No       | Is the type of response that this command will return. This could be any C# type that you want, or even a custom type if you want, but in that case, you'll need to add a using statement for it manually. | _bool_          |

> You can also add any of the above features after the fact using the [`add feature` command](/docs/add-feature).

## Keys and Relationships

There are a couple of important pieces of information to know about settings keys for scaffolding:

1. As v0.12+, you do not need to add a primary key property to your entities as they will automatically be inherited from the `BaseEntity`.
2. Foreign keys do not need to be added. See how relationships are managed below.

Relationships can be set up by adding a special property that looks something like this:

```yaml
- Name: Product
  Relationship: manyto1
  ForeignEntityName: Product
  ForeignEntityPlural: Products
```

The different type of relationships are:

- `1tomany` where the principal entity is the `1` and the foreign entity is the `many`. For example, a `Customer` can have many `Orders`.
- `manyto1` where the principal entity is the `many` and the foreign entity is the `1`. For example, a `Product` can have many `Categories`.
- `manytomany` where the principal entity is the entity that the property is added to. For example, a `Product` can have many `Tags`.
- `1to1` where the principal entity is the entity that the property is added to. For example, a `Customer` can have one `CustomerSettings`.
- `self` where the principal entity is the same as the foreign entity. For example, a `Category` can have many `SubCategories`.

Note that child entities are managed from the principal entity. So for example, if you have a `Customer` that manage
`Order` entities through something like `Customer.AddOrder()`, the `Customer` would be the principal and you would use
a `1tomany` on the `Customer`. If you wanted to manage the `Customer` from an `Order` entity with something like
`Order.SetCustomer()`, you would use a `manyto1` on the `Order` entity. **The main question you should ask yourself when adding a relationship and picking which entity to put it on should
be 'where should this concept be managed from?'**. This will help you establish the principal owner of the relationship.

If you're doing an `add entities` command and your principal entity is already in the project, you can still add the relationship by adding an `IsChildRelationship: true`.

> ðŸ’¡ Note that you'll need to flip the relationship type when adding a child relationship. So if you would normally add a `1tomany` `Order` relationship on a `Customer`, when adding it as a child on `Order`,
> you'll want to make the `Customer` relationship a `manyto1` relationship.

Notice the difference in the examples below, with the first being the principal based example and the second being the child based example.

```yaml
- Name: Customer
  Features:
    - Type: GetList
    - Type: GetAll
    - Type: GetRecord
    - Type: AddRecord
    - Type: UpdateRecord
    - Type: DeleteRecord
    - Type: Job
      Name: PerformCustomerMigration

### Composite Keys

For the time being, composite keys can not be created using Craftsman commands. With that said, you are more than welcome to scaffold out an entity with one of the keys and then
modify the generated entity, repository, tests, etc. to accommodate that composite key.

## Policies

If using auth, you can protect features with a particular permission. In the example below, I
have a permission for doing read overall and default permissions for each destructive feature.

```yaml
Entities:
  - Name: Recipe
    Features:
      - Type: GetList
        IsProtected: true
        PermissionName: CanReadRecipes
      - Type: GetRecord
        IsProtected: true
        PermissionName: CanReadRecipes
      - Type: AddRecord
        IsProtected: true
      - Type: UpdateRecord
        IsProtected: true
      - Type: DeleteRecord
        IsProtected: true
    Properties:
      - Name: Title
        Type: string
      - Name: Directions
        Type: string
```

## Smart Enums

If you want to use smart enums, you can use the `SmartNames` property like so:

```yaml
Entities:
  - Name: Recipe
    Features:
    #...
    Properties:
      - Name: Title
        Type: string
      - Name: Visibility
        SmartNames:
          - Public
          - Friends Only
          - Private
```
