title: Value Objects
description: A walkthrough of working with Value Objects in Wrapt projects
---

## What are Value Objects?

We use them to group a set of related attributes and behavior related to those attributes.

- Value objects don't have a key, they are just a collection of one or more properties.
- Like entities should protect themselves from being in an “invalid state”. Meaning, we should validate
  incoming data in a constructor or in a factory method and do not allow the creation of value.
  objects that do not conform to business rules.
- Value objects can be composed of other value objects.
- Equality is based on values of attributes and nothing else.

### Common Value Objects

When scaffolding a new project >=0.16.0, Craftsman will generate several common Value Objects. You can delete these
if you don't need them. You can also use them as examples to create your own custom value objects for your domain.

- Percent
- MonetaryAmount
- Address
- Postal Code (child of Address)

### Examples

Let's look at a couple of examples in more detail.

#### Percent

While percentages could be represented with just a `decimal` value, we want to be able to add
additional rules and capabilities to that concept to have it be able to more accurately reflect how it
behaves in real life.

In this case, that really just mean making sure that the value is greater than 0, but we can also add operators
for a better DX.

For example, we might have something like this:

```csharp
namespace RecipeManagement.Domain.Percents;

using SharedKernel.Domain;
using FluentValidation;

// source: https://github.com/asc-lab/better-code-with-ddd/blob/ef_core/LoanApplication.TacticalDdd/LoanApplication.TacticalDdd/DomainModel/Percent.cs
public class Percent : ValueObject
{
    public decimal Value { get; }

    public static readonly Percent Zero = new Percent(0M);

    public Percent(decimal value)
    {
        if (value < 0)
            throw new ArgumentException("Percent value cannot be negative");

        Value = value;
    }

    public static bool operator >(Percent one, Percent two) => one.CompareTo(two)>0;

    public static bool operator <(Percent one, Percent two) => one.CompareTo(two)<0;

    public static bool operator >=(Percent one, Percent two) => one.CompareTo(two)>=0;

    public static bool operator <=(Percent one, Percent two) => one.CompareTo(two)<=0;

    private int CompareTo(Percent other)
    {
        return Value.CompareTo(other.Value);
    }

    protected Percent() { } // EF Core
}

public static class PercentExtensions
{
    public static Percent Percent(this int value) => new Percent(value);

    public static Percent Percent(this decimal value) => new Percent(value);
}
```

#### Address

Another one that I think represents this concept well is an `Address`. An address is just
a collection of various properties (street, city, state, etc) that when combined together,
always represent teh same location. There isn't a need for an instance of that concept as
`123 Cherry Street Columbus Ohio` with an id of `1` is the same location as
`123 Cherry Street Columbus Ohio` with an id of `2`. You can also add business rules around
various properties, though an `Address` can actually get really complex as the rules vary
depending where you are in the world.

Craftsman will generate a basic `Address` class like below for you and you can add whatever rules
make sense for your context. Note that there is also a child value object for `PostalCode` for you
to use as well. For instance, maybe you have validation rules for `PostalCode` if the country is
in the US or Canada. You could even expand it further and make a `Country` value object if you want.

```csharp
namespace RecipeManagement.Domain.Addresses;

using SharedKernel.Domain;
using FluentValidation;

public class Address : ValueObject
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Address line 1 (e.g., street, PO Box, or company name).
    /// </summary>
    public string Line1 { get; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Address line 2 (e.g., apartment, suite, unit, or building).
    /// </summary>
    public string Line2 { get; }

    /// <summary>
    /// City, district, suburb, town, or village.
    /// </summary>
    public string City { get; }

    /// <summary>
    /// State, county, province, or region.
    /// </summary>
    public string State { get; }

    /// <summary>
    /// ZIP or postal code.
    /// </summary>
    public PostalCode PostalCode { get; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Two-letter country code <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2">(ISO 3166-1 alpha-2)</a>.
    /// </summary>
    public string Country { get; }

    public Address(string line1, string line2, string city, string state, string postalCode, string country)
        : this(line1, line2, city, state, PostalCode.Of(postalCode), country)
    {
    }

    public Address(string line1, string line2, string city, string state, PostalCode postalCode, string country)
    {
        // TODO country validation

        Line1 = line1;
        Line2 = line2;
        City = city;
        State = state;
        PostalCode = postalCode;
        Country = country;
    }
}

public class PostalCode : ValueObject
{
    public string Value { get; }
    public PostalCode(string value)
    {
        Value = value;
    }

    public static PostalCode Of(string postalCode) => new PostalCode(postalCode);
    public static implicit operator string(PostalCode postalCode) => postalCode.Value;
}
```

## How to Add a Value Object to an Entity

Whether you're creating your own Value Object, or using an existing one, the below steps are
normally needed to add a Value Object to an Entity in your project.

Let's look at how we might add an `Address` value object to the `Author` entity from a
`Complex` Craftsman example (`craftsman new example`).

### Setup Your Entity

There are two steps in this section:

1. Add the property to your entity (i.e. `PhysicalAddress`)
2. Add manual mappings to your factories

```csharp
public class Author : BaseEntity
{
    [Sieve(CanFilter = true, CanSort = true)]
    public virtual string Name { get; private set; }
    public virtual Address PhysicalAddress { get; private set; }

    [JsonIgnore]
    [IgnoreDataMember]
    [ForeignKey("Recipe")]
    public virtual Guid RecipeId { get; private set; }
    public virtual Recipe Recipe { get; private set; }


    public static Author Create(AuthorForCreationDto authorForCreationDto)
    {
        new AuthorForCreationDtoValidator().ValidateAndThrow(authorForCreationDto);

        var newAuthor = new Author();

        newAuthor.Name = authorForCreationDto.Name;
        newAuthor.RecipeId = authorForCreationDto.RecipeId;
        newAuthor.PhysicalAddress = new Address(authorForCreationDto.PhysicalAddress.Line1,
            authorForCreationDto.PhysicalAddress.Line2,
            authorForCreationDto.PhysicalAddress.City,
            authorForCreationDto.PhysicalAddress.State,
            authorForCreationDto.PhysicalAddress.PostalCode,
            authorForCreationDto.PhysicalAddress.Country);

        newAuthor.QueueDomainEvent(new AuthorCreated(){ Author = newAuthor });

        return newAuthor;
    }

    public void Update(AuthorForUpdateDto authorForUpdateDto)
    {
        new AuthorForUpdateDtoValidator().ValidateAndThrow(authorForUpdateDto);

        Name = authorForUpdateDto.Name;
        RecipeId = authorForUpdateDto.RecipeId;
        PhysicalAddress = new Address(authorForUpdateDto.PhysicalAddress.Line1,
            authorForUpdateDto.PhysicalAddress.Line2,
            authorForUpdateDto.PhysicalAddress.City,
            authorForUpdateDto.PhysicalAddress.State,
            authorForUpdateDto.PhysicalAddress.PostalCode,
            authorForUpdateDto.PhysicalAddress.Country);

        QueueDomainEvent(new AuthorUpdated(){ Id = Id });
    }

    protected Author() { } // For EF + Mocking
}
```

### Update your DTOs

Next, I'm going to update my DTOs. For simple value objects with just one property,
I can just add a primitive that will be mapped to that value on the `Read` and `Manipulation`
Dtos, but notice how for a more complex Value Object with multiple properties, I'm going to
use distinct DTOs objects and put them on the `Create` and `Update` Dtos since the
inheritance for a nested Dto on `Manipulation` would get overbearing.

```csharp
    public class AuthorDto
    {
        public Guid Id { get; set; }
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public AddressDto PhysicalAddress { get; set; }
        public Guid RecipeId { get; set; }
    }
    public class AuthorForCreationDto : AuthorForManipulationDto
    {
        public AddressForCreationDto PhysicalAddress { get; set; }
    }
    public class AuthorForUpdateDto : AuthorForManipulationDto
    {
        public AddressForUpdateDto PhysicalAddress { get; set; }
    }
```

### Configure Entity EntityFrameworkCore

Next, you're going to want to tell EF how to read this property. In a Wrapt project, you can just
update your entity's database config to point each property to a particular column.

```csharp
public class AuthorConfiguration : IEntityTypeConfiguration<Author>
{
    /// <summary>
    /// The database configuration for Authors.
    /// </summary>
    public void Configure(EntityTypeBuilder<Author> builder)
    {
        builder.OwnsOne(x => x.PhysicalAddress, opts =>
        {
            opts.Property(x => x.Line1).HasColumnName("physical_address_line1");
            opts.Property(x => x.Line2).HasColumnName("physical_address_line2");
            opts.Property(x => x.City).HasColumnName("physical_address_city");
            opts.Property(x => x.State).HasColumnName("physical_address_state");
            opts.Property(x => x.PostalCode).HasColumnName("physical_address_postal_code")
                .HasConversion(x => x.Value, x => new PostalCode(x));
            opts.Property(x => x.Country).HasColumnName("physical_address_country");
        }).Navigation(x => x.PhysicalAddress);
    }
}
```

### Add a Migration

Speaking of your database, you'll want to add a new database migration.

```bash
dotnet ef migrations add AddPhysicalAddressToAuthor
```

### Update Your Tests

Finally, you'll likely need to update some of your assertions to help give fluent assertions a bit more direction.
Something like the below covers a complex value object example (`PhysicalAddress`) where we
exclude a complex object and explicity assert it. It also covers a more simple example with `PostalCode`
where we need to use their property name for the assertion (i.e. `PostalCode.Value`).

```csharp
    public void can_update_author()
    {
        // Arrange
        var fakeAuthor = FakeAuthor.Generate();
        var updatedAuthor = new FakeAuthorForUpdateDto().Generate();

        // Act
        fakeAuthor.Update(updatedAuthor);

        // Assert
        fakeAuthor.Should().BeEquivalentTo(updatedAuthor, options =>
            options.ExcludingMissingMembers()
                .Excluding(x => x.PhysicalAddress));
        fakeAuthor.PhysicalAddress.Should().BeEquivalentTo(updatedAuthor.PhysicalAddress,
            options => options.Excluding(x => x.PostalCode));
        fakeAuthor.PhysicalAddress.PostalCode.Value.Should().BeEquivalentTo(updatedAuthor.PhysicalAddress.PostalCode);
    }
```
