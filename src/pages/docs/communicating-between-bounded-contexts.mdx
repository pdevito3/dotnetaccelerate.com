title: Communicating Between Bounded Contexts
description: Details on how to publish and consume messages using MassTransit to communicate between bounded contexts.
---

## Introduction
Wrapt projects are broken up into distinct boundaries called [bounded contexts](/docs/bounded-contexts#bounded-contexts). With this kind of separation you may need to communicate between bounded 
contexts for whatever reason. 

to do this, you can either call another boundary in process using a REST request from your feature or out of process by queuing up a message in a message broker. 
Generally, this would be one bounded context sending out a notification that an event occurred and one or more additional bounded contexts reacting to that notification 
to perform some action in response. Some examples might be:

1. A `OrderRequested` notification being sent and and getting consumed by a `BillOrder` consumer as well as a `ConfirmOrder` consumer. You could even take this a step further and create a saga or routing slip to orchestrate the process.
2. You update a `Patient` record in the `Ordering` bounded context and send out a `PatientUpdated` notification so that the `Billing` bounded context can update the associated patient information in their database as well.

> ðŸ’¡ If you're not familiar with eventing and MassTransit, I've started [a blog series](https://wrapt.dev/blog/building-an-event-driven-dotnet-application-the-fundamentals) on the topic that I recommend you check out.

## Example
Let's look at an example like #2 above and say that I have a project built with the below domain template. Of note for this example:
* I have a producer in my `Ordering` bc as well as a matching consumer in my `Billing` bc
* I also have a message in my domain to send between the two
* I am using a fanout exchange as there is no particular routing key needed for this scenario
* I'm using the `AddBus` property to make sure that I am adding my event bus to each bc

So the idea here is that, when we update a patient in `Ordering` we want to send out a notification that we did that for other bounded contexts to know about. So Craftsman scaffolded out a producer for us in 
`VsaLab.Ordering.src.Ordering.WebApi.Features.Producers`, but we want to emit the event when we update a patient, so let's move the event publishing to our `UpdatePatient` feature. To do this, I'm going to add an `IPublishEndpoint` 
move the publishing code to my `UpdatePatient` feature, and delete the producer that we don't need in this case. 

The message publishing looks like this. All I'm doing here is adding the patient id from the command to an anonymous object to use as our message and then publishing that message.
```csharp
  var message = new
  {
      request.PatientId
  };
  await _publishEndpoint.Publish<IPatientUpdated>(message);
```

When we're done, our `UpdatePatient` feature will look something like this:
```csharp
namespace Ordering.WebApi.Features.Patients
{
    using Ordering.Core.Entities;
    using Ordering.Core.Dtos.Patient;
    using Ordering.Core.Exceptions;
    using Ordering.Infrastructure.Contexts;
    using Ordering.WebApi.Features.Patients.Validators;
    using AutoMapper;
    using AutoMapper.QueryableExtensions;
    using MediatR;
    using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
    using System;
    using System.Threading;
    using System.Threading.Tasks;
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using MassTransit;
    using Messages;

    public static class UpdatePatient
    {
        public class UpdatePatientCommand : IRequest<bool>
        {
            public Guid PatientId { get; set; }
            public PatientForUpdateDto PatientToUpdate { get; set; }

            public UpdatePatientCommand(Guid patient, PatientForUpdateDto patientToUpdate)
            {
                PatientId = patient;
                PatientToUpdate = patientToUpdate;
            }
        }

        public class Handler : IRequestHandler<UpdatePatientCommand, bool>
        {
            private readonly IPublishEndpoint _publishEndpoint;
            private readonly OrderingDbContext _db;
            private readonly IMapper _mapper;

            public Handler(OrderingDbContext db, IMapper mapper, IPublishEndpoint publishEndpoint)
            {
                _publishEndpoint = publishEndpoint;
                _mapper = mapper;
                _db = db;
            }

            public async Task<bool> Handle(UpdatePatientCommand request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
            {
                var recordToUpdate = await _db.Patients
                    .FirstOrDefaultAsync(p => p.PatientId == request.PatientId);

                if (recordToUpdate == null)
                {
                    // log error
                    throw new KeyNotFoundException();
                }

                _mapper.Map(request.PatientToUpdate, recordToUpdate);
                var saveSuccessful = await _db.SaveChangesAsync() > 0;

                if (!saveSuccessful)
                {
                    // add log
                    throw new Exception("Unable to save the requested changes. Please check the logs for more information.");
                }

                var message = new
                {
                    request.PatientId
                };
                await _publishEndpoint.Publish<IPatientUpdated>(message);

                return true;
            }
        }
    }
}
```


Now, our consumer is already set up in our `Billing` bc, so if we set both projects as startup projects and put a breakpoint in our consumer, you should see it get hit! This completes the connection to communicate between the bounded contexts. 
From here, you can add whatever work needs to be done in the consumer. In this case, we are only sending the `PatientId`, so you'd probably need to make a call back to `Ordering` to get the entire set of patient information. Another option 
could be to add all of the patient properties to the message and save yourself a call back to `Ordering` for all the patient info.
