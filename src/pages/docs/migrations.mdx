## Automatic Database Migrations

## Using Database Migrations
As of v0.9.0, an initial database migration will automatically be ran during every `new:domain` or `add:bc` command, so you should have an initial migration ready for you from the get go. 
There is a built in timeout or you might not have the Entity Framework CLI installed, so you may need to run migrations manually after the fact. 

Because Wrapt projects use a multi-environment setup, you will need to set an `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` before running `dotnet ef` commands to let 
the host builder locate the appropriate settings file to use. Here's some examples for 
[Windows](https://superuser.com/questions/949560/how-do-i-set-system-environment-variables-in-windows-10), 
[Bash](https://askubuntu.com/questions/58814/how-do-i-add-environment-variables), 
and [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_environment_variables?view=powershell-7). 

If you'd like to track the feature request for an inline command in EF, you can follow [the Github issue](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/8695).

When running migrations, make sure your `UseInMemoryDatabase` setting is set to `false` in your appsettings. This should be the case by default on all environments that are not `Development`.

## Database Migration Example
1. Make sure you have `dotnet ef` installed. To install it globally run:
  ```shell
  dotnet tool install -g dotnet-ef
  ```

2. Set your env variable (e.g. Development) that matches the environment name suffixed on Startup. The default `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` is `Production` [if none has been been set](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/environments?view=aspnetcore-5.0).

  *Powershell*
  ```powershell
  $Env:ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT = "Development"
  ```

  *Bash*
  ```bash
  export ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development
  ```

3. If you don't have any migrations for whatever reason, you can perform your first migration with something like the below where `Ordering` 
is the solution name for this bounded context. Note that you should be in the `src` directory of the bounded context that you want to run your migrations on.
  ```shell
  dotnet ef migrations add "InitialMigration" --project Ordering.Infrastructure --startup-project Ordering.WebApi --output-dir Migrations
  ```

  > Your migrations should be under the project you are running them on, so in this case `Ordering.Infrastructure`

4. To add additional migrations, you can do something like this with  `Ordering` again being the solution name for this bounded context. Make sure that your `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` has been set.
  ```shell
  dotnet ef migrations add "added X column to y entity" --project Ordering.Infrastructure --startup-project Ordering.WebApi --output-dir Migrations
  ```

5. To push the updates to your database, you can run this (note that we're using the shorthand options in this case, but it doesn't matter which is used in any of the examples):
  ```shell
  dotnet ef database update -p Ordering.Infrastructure -s Ordering.WebApi
  ```

## Common Db Migration Error

If you're getting an error like the below, make sure that your connection string is set in your `appsettings.json` file and `UseInMemoryDatabase` is set to `false`.

```
Unable to resolve service for type 'Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Migrations.IMigrator'. This is often because no database provider has been configured for this DbContext. A provider can be configured by overriding the DbContext.OnConfiguring method or by using AddDbContext on the application service provider. If AddDbContext is used, then also ensure that your DbContext type accepts a DbContextOptions<TContext> object in its constructor and passes it to the base constructor for DbContext.
