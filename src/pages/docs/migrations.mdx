title: Database Migrations
description: Details on how to work with EF Database Migrations with .NET 6 APIs built using Wrapt.

## Using Database Migrations
As of v0.9.0, an initial database migration will automatically be ran during every `new:domain` or `add:bc` command, so you should have an initial migration ready for you from the get go. 
There is a built in timeout or you might not have the Entity Framework CLI installed, so you may need to run migrations manually after the fact. 

Because Wrapt projects use an in-memory db while in the `Development` environment, you will need to set an `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` before running `dotnet ef` commands to let 
the host builder locate the appropriate settings file to use. Here's some examples for 
[Windows](https://superuser.com/questions/949560/how-do-i-set-system-environment-variables-in-windows-10), 
[Bash](https://askubuntu.com/questions/58814/how-do-i-add-environment-variables), 
and [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_environment_variables?view=powershell-7). 

If you'd like to track the feature request for an inline command in EF, you can follow [the Github issue](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/8695).

When running migrations, make sure your `UseInMemoryDatabase` setting is set to `false` in your appsettings. This should be the case by default on all environments that are not `Development`.

## Database Migration Example
1. Make sure you have `dotnet ef` installed. To install it globally run:
  ```shell
  dotnet tool install -g dotnet-ef
  ```

2. Make sure your `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` variable is et to literally anything except `Development`. This is because the in-memory database is used 
in the `Development` environment.

  *Powershell*
  ```powershell
  $Env:ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT = "anything"
  ```

  *Bash*
  ```bash
  export ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=anything
  ```

3. If you don't have any migrations for whatever reason, you can perform your first migration with something like the below.
  ```shell
  cd YourBoundedContextName/src/YourBoundedContextName
  dotnet ef migrations add InitialMigration
  ```


4. To add additional migrations, just change your migration description.
  ```shell
  cd YourBoundedContextName/src/YourBoundedContextName
  dotnet ef migrations add AddedColumnXToTableY
  ```

5. To push the updates to your database, you can run this (note that we're using the shorthand options in this case, but it doesn't matter which is used in any of the examples):
  ```shell
  cd YourBoundedContextName/src/YourBoundedContextName
  dotnet ef database update
  ```

## Common Db Migration Error

If you're getting an error like the below, make sure that you set your `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` to anything but `Development` before running migrations. Literally, you could set it to `anything` and it should work.

```
Unable to resolve service for type 'Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Migrations.IMigrator'. This is often because no database provider has been configured for this DbContext. A provider can be configured by overriding the DbContext.OnConfiguring method or by using AddDbContext on the application service provider. If AddDbContext is used, then also ensure that your DbContext type accepts a DbContextOptions<TContext> object in its constructor and passes it to the base constructor for DbContext.
```

Additionally, if you are running Integration tests and see something like the below, make sure that you have migrations in your project.
