## Git

By default, Wrapt will do some initial git setup for you (`git init`, `git add -a`, `git commit -m "Initial commit"`, and add a `.gitignore`).

If you'd like to skip this and do it yourself, you can set the `AddGit` option to `false` on the base level.

```yaml
AddGit: false
```

## Git User

By default, the git setup will use the system user. If you'd like to change this to use a generic `Craftsman` user, you
can set `UseSystemGitUser` to `false` on the root level.

## Git Examples

In this example we have a `yaml` file that's setting up an API for a Vet Clinic. You can see that `AddGit` is set to false, so no git setup will be performed.

```yaml
ProjectName: VetClinic.Api
AddGit: false
Entities:
#entity details
```

Here, we are setting up our domain to have our initial commit with Craftsman as the author.

```yaml
ProjectName: VetClinic.Api
UseSystemGitUser: false
Entities:
#entity details
```
