| IsLazy                         | No       | A boolean that determines whether or not you want to use a lazy queue. This is [generally recommended as a best practice](https://www.cloudamqp.com/blog/part1-rabbitmq-best-practice.html#enable-lazy-queues-to-get-predictable-performance). Generally, these can be disabled if you require really high performance, if the queues are always short, or if you have set a max-length policy | _true_   |
| UsesDb                         | No       | A boolean that determines whether ot not the scaffolded consumer feature will inject the db context in the project.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | _true_   |

> When adding consumers to an existing project, be sure to run the `add bus` command if you don't already have a message bus in your project. This bus command should be completed _before_ running an `add consumer` command.

## Add Consumer Template Examples

### Adding a Consumer with Your Domain or Bounded Context

In this example, we're adding a message bus, consumer, message, and producer to our project. Notice how the exchange and message names match between the producer and the consumer.

```yaml
DomainName: WeSendReportsCompany
Messages:
  - Name: ISendReportRequest
    Properties:
      - Name: ReportId
        Type: guid
      - Name: Provider
        Type: string
      - Name: Target
        Type: string
BoundedContexts:
  - ProjectName: Reporting
    Producers:
      - EndpointRegistrationMethodName: SubmitReportRequest
        ExchangeName: report-requests
        MessageName: ISendReportRequest
        ExchangeType: fanout
        ProducerName: ReportWasRequested
        UsesDb: true
    Consumers:
      - EndpointRegistrationMethodName: AllReportsGetSentFromHereEndpoint
        ConsumerName: SenderOfAllReports
        ExchangeName: report-requests
        MessageName: ISendReportRequest
        QueueName: all-reports
        ExchangeType: fanout
    Bus:
      AddBus: true
    # additional new domain properties here
```

### Adding a Consumer to an Existing Project

If you've already created your Wrapt project and want to add one or more consumers after the fact, you can use the `add consumer` command to pass through one or more consumers to your project.
Make sure you have a message bus already in your project. If you don't have a bus, you add one with the `add bus` command.

This particular example will add consumers using a direct exchange.

```yaml
Consumers:
  - EndpointRegistrationMethodName: EmailReportsEndpoint
    ConsumerName: EmailConsumer
    ExchangeName: report-requests
    MessageName: ISendReportRequest
    QueueName: email-reports
    ExchangeType: direct
    RoutingKey: email
  - EndpointRegistrationMethodName: FaxReportsEndpoint
    ConsumerName: FaxConsumer
    ExchangeName: report-requests
    QueueName: fax-reports
    MessageName: ISendReportRequest
    ExchangeType: direct
    RoutingKey: fax
    IsLazy: false
    IsQuorum: false
```

If you wanted to do a `topic` exchange, it might look like this:

```yaml
Consumers:
  - EndpointRegistrationMethodName: CloudReportsEndpoint
    ConsumerName: CloudConsumer
    ExchangeName: report-requests
    QueueName: cloud-reports
    MessageName: ISendReportRequest
    ExchangeType: topic
    RoutingKey: public.*
```
