| Name       | Required | Description                                                         | Default                          | Notes |
| ---------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------|
| AddBus        | Yes      | A boolean to indicate that you are adding a bus. | *None*   | **Not required for the `add:bus` command.**  |
| [Environments](/docs/multiple-environments)    | No      | The environments that get scaffolded out in this project. You only need to use the `EnvironmentName` and the `BrokerSettings` with this command.  | *None*   | |

## Add Bus Template Examples

### Adding a Bus with Your Domain

If you're adding a bus in your `new:domain` command, then you can add the appropriate broker details to your `Environments` property and add an `AddBus` property to make sure Craftsman knows to add the bus.

```yaml
DomainName: WeSendReportsCompanyWithBusAndTestSetup
BoundedContexts:
- SolutionName: Reporting
  Environments:
  - EnvironmentName: Development
    BrokerSettings:
      Host: localhost
      VirtualHost: /
      Username: guest
      Password: guest
  - EnvironmentName: Production
    BrokerSettings:
      Host: rmqlocalprod
      VirtualHost: dashprod
      Username: testprod
      Password: testprod
  Bus:
    AddBus: true
  # additional new:domain properties here
```


### Adding a Bus to an Existing Project
If you've already created your Wrapt project and want to add a bus after the fact, you can use the `add:bus` command which will only require the `Environments` property (`AddBus` can be automatically set to true with the command given the intent behind the command ðŸ™‚). 
Notice how you don't need to add any of the other normal `Environment` properties other than `EnvironmentName` and `BrokerSettings`. 

This particular example will add bus info for Development and Production (Startup).

```yaml
Environments:
- EnvironmentName: Development
  BrokerSettings:
    Host: localhost
    VirtualHost: /
    Username: guest
    Password: guest
- EnvironmentName: Production
  BrokerSettings:
    Host: rmqlocalprod
    VirtualHost: dashprod
    Username: testprod
    Password: testprod
```

> At the moment, if you are connecting to anything outside of development, you may need to make some tweaks to include SSL and a port. For example, this CloudAMQP connection:

```csharp
cfg.Host("baboon.rmq.cloudamqp.com", 8983, "kalvak", h =>
{
    h.Username("kalvak:kalvak");
    h.Password("supersecretpassword");

    h.UseSsl(s =>
    {
        s.Protocol = SslProtocols.Tls12;
    });
});
```
