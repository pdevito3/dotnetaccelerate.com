## Add Bus Template Examples

### Adding a Bus with Your Domain or Bounded Context

To add a message bus to your domain or bounded context,you only need to use the `AddBus` property:

```yaml
DomainName: WeSendReportsCompany
BoundedContexts:
  - ProjectName: Reporting
    Bus:
      AddBus: true
# additional template info
```

Optionally, you can update the bus connection info if you want:

```yaml
DomainName: WeSendReportsCompany
BoundedContexts:
  - ProjectName: Reporting
    Environment:
      BrokerSettings:
        Username: specialguest
        Password: specialguest
    Bus:
      AddBus: true
    # additional new domain properties here
```

### Adding a Bus to an Existing Project

If you've already created your Wrapt project and want to add a bus after the fact, you can use the `add bus` command.
No need to pass a file, but you can if you want to set the environment properties. The `AddBus` property is not necessary
in this context.

```yaml
BoundedContexts:
  - ProjectName: Reporting
    Environment:
      BrokerSettings:
        Username: specialguest
        Password: specialguest
```

<!-- > At the moment, if you are connecting to anything outside of development, you may need to make some tweaks to include SSL and a port. For example, this CloudAMQP connection:

```csharp
cfg.Host("baboon.rmq.cloudamqp.com", 8983, "kalvak", h =>
{
    h.Username("kalvak:kalvak");
    h.Password("supersecretpassword");

    h.UseSsl(s =>
    {
        s.Protocol = SslProtocols.Tls12;
    });
});
``` -->
