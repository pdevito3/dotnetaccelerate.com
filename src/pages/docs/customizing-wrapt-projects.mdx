## Customization
So you've ran your `new:domain` command and have your API scaffolded out, but you want to make some customizations for your business logic. 

At this point you can go anywhere into the project and modify whatever you want! There are a handful of spots throughout the project 
that are marked with comments or regions that will tell you what needs to be left alone for Craftsman to be able to work with it in 
the future, but even those can be modified if you'd like. Just keep in mind that you'll no longer to be able to reliably use 
Craftsman commands in your project.

For example, if you go into an Entity file, you'll notice a comment at the bottom like this `// add-on property marker - Do Not 
Delete This Comment`. This comment is what Craftsman will look for when adding new properties to your entity, so if it were removed,
that operation would no longer be able to run properly.

## Smart Defaults
Wrapt projects are set up with some opinionated defaults so you don't have to think about where to put things (though you can put them elsewhere if you so chose).
