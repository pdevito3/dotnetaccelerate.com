## Db Context 

An object that describes the basic information for your database. At the moment, only one application DbContext is supported per API.

| Name          | Required | Description                                                  | Default   |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- |
| DbContextName | Yes      | A single key value pair that designates the name you want to use for your API. | *None*    |
| DatabaseName  | Yes      | The name of your database.                                   | *None*    |
| Provider      | No       | An enumerator that designated the database provider for your DbContext. Case insensitive.   | SqlServer |
| NamingConvention  | No      | The naming convention for your database. Case insensitive.                                 | *SnakeCase*    |

### Providers
These are the valid options for the `Provider` property:
- SqlServer
- Postgres
- MySQL (Coming Soon)

> You can still add MySql to your project manually. It has not been built in directly yet because, as of writing this, the MySQl nuget package is 
currently in pre-release, so you'll either want to add the prerelease or drop back to .NET Core 3.1 until it's ready.


### Naming Conventions
- `Class` uses the built in .NET styling
- SnakeCase
- LowerCase
- CamelCase
- UpperCase

## Example
In this example, we are creating a Sql Server database with a database name of `VetClinic` and a DbContext of `VetClinicDbContext`.
```yaml
DbContext:
  ContextName: VetClinicDbContext
  DatabaseName: VetClinic
  Provider: SqlServer
```
