description: Notes on working setting up environment variables and launch settings in your project.

## Background

Wrapt projects use environment variables to configure their behavior. These are set in the launch settings profile that is used
when running your project and makes it easy to deploy your project and pass it values for that new environment.

## Environment Properties

These are the properties for working LOCALLY on your machine and will be adding to your launch settings file. When working in other
environments, you will need to set these properties in that new environment as well.

### Example with Auth and Broker Settings

In this example, we are not adding any new environments, but adding auth and broker info for `Development` (our local, in memory project).

```yaml
Environment:
  AuthSettings:
    Authority: https://localhost:3385
    Audience: recipe_management
    AuthorizationUrl: https://localhost:3385/connect/authorize
    TokenUrl: https://localhost:3385/connect/token
    ClientId: recipe_management.swagger
    ClientSecret: 974d6f71-d41b-4601-9a7a-a33081f80687
  BrokerSettings:
    Host: localhost
    VirtualHost: /
    Username: guest
    Password: guest
```

<!-- > At the moment, if you are connecting to anything outside of development, you may need to make some tweaks to include SSL and a port. For example, this CloudAMQP connection:

```csharp
cfg.Host("baboon.rmq.cloudamqp.com", 8983, "kalvak", h =>
{
    h.Username("kalvak:kalvak");
    h.Password("supersecretpassword");

    h.UseSsl(s =>
    {
        s.Protocol = SslProtocols.Tls12;
    });
});

``` -->
