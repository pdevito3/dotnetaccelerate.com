## Bounded Contexts

A bounded context is a logical contextual boundary within your domain, in the same vein that it is used in Domain Driven Design (DDD). For example, in
a clinical domain, I might have front desk, billing, laboratory, and reporting contexts.

## Bounded Contexts Properties

| Name                                 | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                | Default |

| ProjectName                          | Yes      | A simple string that will become the name of your solution within a bounded context.                                                                                       | _None_  |
| [DbContext](/docs/db-context)        | Yes      | The db context setup for this project.                                                                                                                                     | _None_  |
| [Entities](/docs/entities)           | Yes      | A list of entities to create database endpoints.                                                                                                                           | _None_  |

| [Environment](/docs/environment)     | No       | The environment settings in launch settings for your local development.                                                                                                    | _None_  |
| [Producers](/docs/producer-template) | No       | The MassTransit producers in your project.                                                                                                                                 | _None_  |
| [Consumers](/docs/consumer-template) | No       | The MassTransit consumers in your project.                                                                                                                                 | _None_  |
| [Bus](/docs/bus-template)            | No       | The MassTransit message bus in your project. When used in this context, **the environment properties should be set in the `Environment` property of the bounded context.** | _None_  |
| Port                                 | No       | The port that will be used on localhost for this project.                                                                                                                  | _5000_  |
| UseSoftDelete                        | No       | A boolean that dictates whether or not your `BaseEntity` and `DbContext` will be configured for a soft delete.                                                             | _true_  |
| UseCustomErrorHandler                | No       | A boolean that dictates the type of error handler middleware. By default, the [Hellang Problem Details package](https://github.com/khellang/Middleware) will be used for robustness, but if you want to reduce a dependncy and do custom error handling by setting this to `true`                                                           | _false_  |

> Note that the ProjectName should NOT be the same as an entity name or it will cause namespace issues.

## Bounded Context Example

The example on the [project tutorial](/docs/tutorial#adding-a-new-bounded-context) covers how to add new bounded contexts.
