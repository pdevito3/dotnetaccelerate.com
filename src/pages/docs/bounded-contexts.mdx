## Bounded Contexts
A bounded context is a logical contextual boundary within your domain, in the same vein that it is used in Domain Driven Design (DDD). For example, in
a clinical domain, I might have front desk, billing, laboratory, and reporting contexts.

## Bounded Contexts Properties

| Name       | Required | Description                                                         | Default                          |
| ---------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| SolutionName    | Yes      | A simple string that will become the name of your solution within a bounded context. | *None*   |
| [DbContext](/docs/db-context)       | Yes      | The db context setup for this project. | *None*   |
| [Entities](/docs/entities)        | Yes      | A list of entities to create database endpoints. | *None*   |
| [SwaggerConfig](/docs/swagger)   | No      | The swagger configuration for this API. | *None*   |
| [Environments](/docs/multiple-environments)    | No      | The environments that get scaffolded out in this project. | *None*   |
| [AuthorizationSettings](/docs/authorization-settings)    | No      | The authorization settings assigned to this project. | *None*   |
| [Producers](/docs/producer-template)    | No      | The MassTransit producers in your project. | *None*   |
| [Consumers](/docs/consumer-template)    | No      | The MassTransit consumers in your project. | *None*   |
| [Bus](/docs/bus-template)    | No      | The MassTransit message bus in your project. When used in this context, **the environment properties should be set in the `Environment` property of the bounded context.**   | *None*   |
| Port    | No      | The port that will be used on localhost for this project. | *5000*   |


> Note that the SolutionName should NOT be the same as an entity name or it will cause namespace issues.


## Bounded Context Example
The example on the [project tutorial](/docs/tutorial#adding-a-new-bounded-context) covers how to add new bounded contexts.
