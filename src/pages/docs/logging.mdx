## Wrapt Serilog Implementation
[Serilog](https://serilog.net/) is added by default to all Wrapt APIs for easy logging. This is set in `AddLoggingConfiguration` and configured with basic presets, 
enrichments, and logging levels based on environment. These can be modified to suit your needs however you see fit for your project.
