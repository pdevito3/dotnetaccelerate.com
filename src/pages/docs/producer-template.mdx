## Add Producer Template Properties

| Name                           | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                         | Default  |
| ------------------------------ | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| EndpointRegistrationMethodName | Yes      | A deliberately long name to try and promote readability. This is a string that will determine the name of the method used to register the producer inside MassTransit.              | _None_   |
| ProducerName                   | Yes      | A string that determines the name of the producer.                                                                                                                                  | _None_   |
| MessageName                    | Yes      | A string that determines the name of the message the producer will, well, consume!                                                                                                  | _None_   |
| ExchangeName                   | Yes      | A string that determines the name of the exchange that this producer will be tied to. Note that this should match exchange name in the producer that you want this to be linked to. | _None_   |
| ExchangeType                   | No       | The type of exchange you want to use. This can be set to `fanout`, `direct`, or `topic`.                                                                                            | _fanout_ |
| UsesDb                         | No       | A boolean that determines whether ot not the scaffolded producer feature will inject the db context in the project.                                                                 | _true_   |

> When adding producers to an existing project, be sure to run the `add bus` command if you don't already have a message bus in your project. This bus command should be completed _before_ running an `add producer` command.

## The Producer Routing Key Formatter

If using a `direct` or `topic` exchange, you will need to set the `UseRoutingKeyFormatter` in the producer registration to whatever is appropriate for your project. This formatter will configure what to use for the routing key when sending a message.
This configuration will be located in a file named with whatever the `EndpointRegistrationMethodName` is followed by "Registration". So, if I had a `EndpointRegistrationMethodName` of "SubmitReportRequest", I would go to my
"SubmitReportRequestRegistration" file in the `WebApi.Extensions` directory.

There are some comments in the file giving you an example to reference, but I'll add it here as well.

```csharp
cfg.Send<IMyMessage>(e =>
{
    //Direct example: uses the `ProductType` message property as a key
    e.UseRoutingKeyFormatter(context => context.Message.ProductType.ToString());

    // OR

    // Topic example: uses the VIP Status and ClientType message properties to make a key.
    e.UseRoutingKeyFormatter(context =>
    {
        var vipStatus = context.Message.IsVip ? "vip" : "normal";
        return $"{vipStatus}.{context.Message.ClientType};
    });
});
```

## Add Producer Template Examples

### Adding a Producer with Your Domain or Bounded Context

In this example, we're adding a message bus, consumer, message, and producer to our project. Notice how the exchange and message names match between the producer and the consumer.

```yaml
DomainName: WeSendReportsCompany
Messages:
  - Name: ISendReportRequest
    Properties:
      - Name: ReportId
        Type: guid
      - Name: Provider
        Type: string
      - Name: Target
        Type: string
BoundedContexts:
  - ProjectName: Reporting
    Producers:
      - EndpointRegistrationMethodName: SubmitReportRequest
        ExchangeName: report-requests
        MessageName: ISendReportRequest
        ExchangeType: fanout
        ProducerName: ReportWasRequested
        UsesDb: true
    Consumers:
      - EndpointRegistrationMethodName: AllReportsGetSentFromHereEndpoint
        ConsumerName: SenderOfAllReports
        ExchangeName: report-requests
        MessageName: ISendReportRequest
        QueueName: all-reports
        ExchangeType: fanout
    Bus:
      AddBus: true
    # additional new domain properties here
```

### Adding a Producer to an Existing Project

If you've already created your Wrapt project and want to add one or more producers after the fact, you can use the `add producer` command to pass through one or more producers to your project.
Make sure you have a message bus already in your project. If you don't have a bus, you add one with the `add bus` command.

This particular example will add producers using a direct exchange.

```yaml
Producers:
  - EndpointRegistrationMethodName: EmailRequestor
    ExchangeName: report-requests
    MessageName: ISendReportRequest
    ExchangeType: direct
    ProducerName: EmailWasRequested
    UsesDb: true
```
