shortTitle: Add Feature
description: Adds a new feature and all associated files to a bounded context.
---

This command will add a new empty feature file using prompts, so no template needed here!

> This command must be ran from the *bounded context* directory for a project that was made using the `new:domain` or `add:bc` command. It should have a `src` and `test` directory.

```shell
craftsman add:feature [options]
or
craftsman new:feature [options]
```

## Add Feature Options
| Option          | Description                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| -h, --help      | Display help message. No filepath is needed to display the help message.

## Add Feature Prompts
1. **Feature Name**: The name of the feature. This is the name of the feature's method and would generally be something like `AddCustomer` or `GetCustomer`.
2. **Command Name**: The name of the command. This is the name of the feature's class and would generally be something like `AddCustomerCommand` or `GetCustomerQuery`.
3. **Response Type**: Is the type of response that this command will return. This could be any C# type that you want, or even a custom type if you want, but in that case, you'll need to add a using statement for it manually. **DEFAULT: `bool`**
4. **IsProducer** : Determines whether or not this feature is an event producer. If so, it will add a message bus to the dependency injection. **DEFAULT: `false`**
5. **EntityName**: The name of the entity that the feature will be added to. You can leave this blank to add it to the `Domain` directory directly.

## Add Feature Example Commands
```shell
craftsman add:feature -h
craftsman add:feature
craftsman new:feature
