## Prerequisites

- [Visual Studio 2019 16.8.0+](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) or [.Net 5.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/5.0) 

### Semi-Optional
Docker and dotnet ef are needed for a mock integration test database. You do NOT need these to run the project, but they will be needed to use the built in tests.

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) 
- [dotnet ef](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/cli/dotnet)

## Getting Started
1. Install the `Craftsman` tool globally. This is going to be the workhorse behind all of our commands. **Make sure to close your powershell/command prompt/terminal windows after your initial install!**

   ```shell
   dotnet tool install -g craftsman
   ```

   > If you are using private NuGet sources you may need to temporarily [disable](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-nuget-disable-source) them to properly install the tool. Unfortunately, the dotnet sdk doesn't 
   have a `â€“nuget-source` parameter for `dotnet tool install` commands yet, though I have a [feature request](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/15477) pending if you'd like to track its progress.`

2. Run any of the below for a list of available commands

   ```shell
   craftsman 
   craftsman list
   craftsman -h
   craftsman --help
   ```

3. That's it! Now let's look at [an example](/docs/tutorial) to see it in action.

## Updating Craftsman
To update to the latest version of Craftsman, you can run:
```shell
dotnet tool update -g craftsman
```
