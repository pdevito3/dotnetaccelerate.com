shortTitle: Add Auth Server
description: Adds a Duende auth server to your solution.
---

This command will scaffold out a Duende auth server for your solution. For the time being, this is just the in-memory portion of the auth server, useful for dev,
but will be enhanced with Identity in the coming months. It's also worth noting that consent forms are not scaffolded out yet, but will be added in a future release.

You can find more info and examples in the [input file template](/docs/auth-server-template).

> This command must be ran from your _root_ solution directory.

```shell
craftsman add authserver [options] <filepath>
```
